# minimum_surface_triangle
  Given a set of 2D random points and considering one of them as central point, randomly as well, find the triangle with the smallest surface. It is basically a Knn implementation with a "non-linear" restriction. Comparison between CPU and GPU implementation, maximum number of points: 131072.   ![CPU VS GPU](http:///home/robin/Pictures/Screenshot%20from%202020-10-04%2020-19-48.png)
